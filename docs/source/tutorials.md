# How-to

## Tutorials

New to metadpy? Start with the tutorials below in order. Each notebook is self-contained and can be run locally or in Colab.

**Quick start (recommended order)**
1. Open a notebook from the table below (Colab is easiest if you don't want to install anything).
2. Run the cells top-to-bottom.
3. Replace the example data with your own once you understand the expected columns and format.

## Examples

The example notebooks focus on specific workflows (e.g., MLE vs. Bayesian fits) and are useful as templates once you are comfortable with the tutorial flow.
